        <p>I may have other social media accounts but I rarely use them and have recently been trying not to use any social media that does not respect it's user's freedoms. If you would like to learn more about why I or anyone should 'use' (i.e., be used by) certain social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, or many others, I would suggest taking a look at <a href="https://stallman.org/facebook.html">this article</a> and many others like it written by Richard Stallman.</p>
