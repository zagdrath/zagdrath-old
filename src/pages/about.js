        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Hey, I'm Cody Wellman but I usually go by Zagdrath online and I'm a software developer and an Information Technology specialist. I'm also an advocate for Free Software and the GNU/Linux operating systems as well as a member of the <a href="https://www.fsf.org">Free Software Foundation</a>.</p>
        <p>You can reach me via â€¦</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Email: <a href="mailto:zagdrath@member.fsf.org">zagdrath@member.fsf.org</a></li>
          <li>Twitter: <a href="https://twitter.com/zagdrath">twitter.com/zagdrath</a></li>

        </ul>
        <p>I may have other social media accounts but I rarely use them and have recently been trying not to use any social media that does not respect it's user's freedoms. If you would like to learn more about why I or anyone should not "use" or as I like to say, be used by certain social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, or many others, I would suggest taking a look at <a href="https://stallman.org/facebook.html">this article</a> and many others like it written by Richard Stallman.</p>
